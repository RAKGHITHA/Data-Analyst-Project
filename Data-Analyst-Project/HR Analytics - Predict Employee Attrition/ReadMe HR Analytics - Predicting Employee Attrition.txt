## Project Title:

HR Analytics - Predicting Employee Attrition

## Objective:

To analyze employee data to uncover key causes of attrition (resignation) and build a predictive model that can help HR take preventive actions.

## Tools & Technologies Used:

Python – Data analysis, model building (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SHAP)

Power BI – Data visualization dashboard

Jupyter Notebook – For EDA, model training, and SHAP analysis

## Key Analyses Performed:

EDA on attrition rate by department, job role, salary band, travel frequency

Feature Engineering for model training

Model Building with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

SHAP Analysis to interpret model predictions

## Target Outcome:

Identify patterns contributing to employee attrition

Build a reliable model (~83% accuracy)

Visualize and explain insights using Power BI

Provide actionable retention strategies

## Model Summary:

Model Accuracy: ~83%

Best Model: Decision Tree Classifier

Explainer: SHAP values to understand impact of each feature on predictions
